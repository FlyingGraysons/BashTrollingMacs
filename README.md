# Shell-Script-Mac-Trolling
Trolling people on mac with bash

Most of these are simple Shell scripts which do some sort of trolling.
Some of these are quite dangerous.
Be careful.
If you want to test these, I would recommend a VM, or some sort of isolated testing chamber.

Unfortunately, many of these are not yet finished, and have some problems. Any help would be appreciated.

# ehh.sh
This program creates infinite files named '.woah.poop' followed by a number.
Each file is one gb. This obviously will eat up space. It iterates 10000 times or so. Be careful.
Like all the others, I don't know if it works, because I'm not stupid enough to test it.
It also has the added benefit of running the process in the background and running it through even a logout. It also clears the history, which makes it annoying to trace.
The part that sucks is that this will eat your whole hard drive and there is no stopping it. (If I coded it right--so probably not)

# trollol.d
A copy of ehh.sh in a different language (D), this does not work.

# trolll.sh
This one does not work at all.
Very sad.
This one would also be completely annoying, especially to the non-tech savvy people of the world.
If it worked properly, this would add a line to the hosts file redirecting ALL http and https web traffic and make it go nowhere. Yay.

So, I just found out it will never work because wildcards don't work in host files. Damn.

# trolllllllllolol.sh
I ran out of names.

Yeah.

This one is the cream of the crop. La creme de la creme.

If it worked.

It is supposed use applescript to recursively make windows linking to leekspin.com which is very annoying.
However, the problem comes when someone sees, 'Hey! It's this dumb terminal thing' and they quit out.
We solve that problem by using nohup and &, making it run in the background and with no output. Unfortunately, this does not work right now. Like all the others. Damn.

PS-- I fixed the problem with the nohup and stuff so it might work now, please take testing into your own (or preferable someone elses') #

# opener.sh
This file, when run opens every app installed in the /Applications, ~/Applications, and /Application/Utilities folders, then tells the user that their mac will self destruct.
